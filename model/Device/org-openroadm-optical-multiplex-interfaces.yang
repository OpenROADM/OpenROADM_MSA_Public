                for C-band and L-band:
                - oms-c-band: represents the Open ROADM C-band of approximately

                - oms-l-band: L-band of approximately 186.125-190.925 THz
                Other spectrum band names and ranges may be recommended in the
                future. If not set, the spectrum band is assumed to be the Open
