      "This command will instruct the device to rebalance a set of roadm-connections.
       The device initiates the power rebalancing for the specified connections that are
       in the gainLoss mode. Connections that are in the off or power mode are skipped without error.

       The device validates that the optical signal is good before beginning the rebalancing
       procedure for that connection (e.g., no RX LOS, POS or POR). The device puts the
       connections into an operational power mode without changing the provisioned opticalControlMode.
       After a 12s soak time, the device validates that the optical signal is good at the RX and TX
       ports and within the target-power-threshold of the target-output-power setting. If all conditions
       are met, the device puts the connection back to gainLoss mode with the new internal settings.

       If any issues are detected during or at the end of the rebalancing operation, then the device
       reverts the connection back to the previous gainLoss setting.

       The device raises the rebalancingInProgress condition while the operation is in effect and clears
       the condition at the end of the rebalancing procedure. An adjust-optical-power-result notification
       is sent at the end of the rebalancing procedure that provides the status and results of the procedure.
       Connections that failed the rebalancing validations are reported in this notification along with the
       reason for failure.";
