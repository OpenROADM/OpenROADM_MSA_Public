      "The Light Touch Provisioning (LTP) template provides instructions to
       perform initial provisioning of an OpenROADM device.

       A typical application is to set up the management GCC channel
       of a remote transponder node to achieve controller connectivity.

       A template file contains one or more command sequences for provisioning
       a device. A command sequence is a set of NETCONF commands that are
       executed in order to provision the node.

       Multiple command sequences are provided in a template file when
       different commands are needed for different device software versions.

       A single LTP template is valid for a single vendor and one or more
       device models and node types of this vendor.

       An LTP template is processed by the network management infrastructure
       to replace variables and to create an XML version of
       the LTP provisioning file. During on-site installation of an
       OpenROADM device, the XML provisioning file is uploaded to the device,
       which then executes the command sequence applicable to its
       installed software version.

       Note: Light Touch Provisioning cannot perform a software upgrade
       of a device.
