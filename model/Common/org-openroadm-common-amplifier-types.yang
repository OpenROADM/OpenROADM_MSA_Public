       this parameter allows modeling different operational modes (gain ranges) ,notably for switched-gain amplifiers.
       It indicates which performance model shall be used by the path feasibility engine.
       For standard amplifier, or when performance evaluation is based on incremental noise, use gain-range-1.
       When performance evaluation is based on advanced parameters, specify used gain-range (1 to 4).
       Up to release 2.1, only gain-range-1 is to be used (default value) ";
